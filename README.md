# MercadoLibre-Growth-Analysis
MercadoLibre Growth Analysis Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the financial and user data of MercadoLibre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America with over 200 million users. The main goal is to determine if predicting search traffic can help in successfully trading the company's stock. The analysis involves several steps, including finding unusual patterns in Google Search traffic, mining the search data for seasonality, relating search traffic to stock price patterns, and creating a time series model using Prophet. Optionally, the project also includes forecasting future revenue.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following steps:

Finding Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic

Read the search data into a DataFrame.
Slice the data to the month of May 2020.
Visualize the results using hvPlot.
Calculate the total search traffic for the month and compare it to the monthly median across all months.
Identify any unusual patterns and determine if search traffic increased during the financial results release.
Mining the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality

Group the hourly search data to plot average traffic by day of the week.
Visualize the traffic as a heatmap using hvPlot.
Group the search data by the week of the year to observe seasonal patterns.
Determine if search traffic increases during the winter holiday period (Weeks 40 through 52).
Relating the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns

Read in and plot the stock price data.
Concatenate the stock price data with the search data into a single DataFrame.
Slice the data to the first half of 2020 (2020-01 to 2020-06) and plot using hvPlot.
Create new columns for Lagged Search Trends, Stock Volatility, and Hourly Stock Return.
Review the time series correlation to identify any predictable relationships.
Creating a Time Series Model with Prophet

Set up the Google Search data for a Prophet forecasting model.
Estimate the model and plot the forecast.
Plot the individual time series components of the model.
Answer questions about the popularity of MercadoLibre, time of day, day of the week, and the lowest point for search traffic.
(Optional) Forecasting Revenue by Using Time Series Models

Read in daily historical sales figures.
Apply a Prophet model to the data.
Interpret the model output to identify seasonal patterns in company revenue.
Produce a sales forecast for the next quarter, including best- and worst-case scenarios.

Findings
Unusual Patterns in Search Traffic
The analysis revealed unusual patterns in the search traffic during May 2020, coinciding with the release of MercadoLibre's quarterly financial results. There was a significant increase in search traffic compared to the monthly median across all months.
Seasonality in Search Traffic
The heatmap visualization showed that search traffic tends to peak during certain hours of the day, particularly in the evening. Additionally, search traffic increases during the winter holiday period, especially from Week 40 to Week 52.
Relationship Between Search Traffic and Stock Price
A common trend was observed between the search traffic and stock price during the first half of 2020, aligning with the narrative of increased e-commerce activity during market disruptions.
The time series correlation indicated a potential predictive relationship between lagged search traffic and stock volatility, as well as between lagged search traffic and hourly stock returns.
Prophet Time Series Model
The Prophet model forecasted an increase in the popularity of MercadoLibre in the near term.
The greatest popularity in search traffic occurs in the evening, with Monday being the day of the week with the most traffic.
The lowest point for search traffic was identified in the early part of the year.
Optional Revenue Forecast
The Prophet model applied to historical sales data provided a forecast for the next quarter, highlighting peak revenue days and helping the finance group plan budgets and set investor expectations.
Instructions to Run the Notebook

Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to execute the data analysis and visualization.
Review the comments and markdown cells for explanations and findings at each step of the analysis.
Conclusion
The analysis demonstrated the potential of using Google Search traffic data to predict stock price movements and optimize marketing strategies for MercadoLibre. The Prophet model provided valuable insights into future trends in search traffic and revenue, helping the company make data-driven decisions to drive growth.
